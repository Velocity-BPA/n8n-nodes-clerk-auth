# Streamline Your Authentication Workflows: Introducing the n8n Clerk Auth Node

We're excited to announce the release of our latest community node for n8n: the Clerk Auth integration! Developed by Velocity BPA, this powerful node brings comprehensive user authentication and management capabilities directly into your n8n workflows.

## The Authentication Automation Challenge

Modern applications rely heavily on robust authentication systems, but integrating these services into automation workflows has traditionally required complex API calls, token management, and webhook configurations. For teams using Clerk as their authentication provider, connecting it to n8n workflows meant building custom HTTP requests for every interaction—a time-consuming and error-prone process.

## What Makes This Node Special?

Our n8n-nodes-clerk-auth package eliminates the complexity of working with Clerk's API by providing a user-friendly, visual interface for all your authentication needs. Here's what you can do:

**User Management**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete users directly from your workflows. Perfect for onboarding automation, account provisioning, and user lifecycle management.

**Organization Operations**: Manage organizations, memberships, and permissions programmatically. Ideal for B2B applications with multi-tenant architectures.

**Session Control**: Monitor and manage user sessions, implement security policies, and handle session-related events in real-time.

**Authentication Actions**: Trigger actions based on authentication events, verify tokens, and integrate authentication logic into complex workflows.

**Webhook Support**: Receive and process Clerk webhooks seamlessly, enabling event-driven automation for user activities, sign-ups, and security events.

## Getting Started

Installing the Clerk Auth node is straightforward:


npm install n8n-nodes-clerk-auth


Once installed, the node will appear in your n8n editor, ready to be dragged into your workflows. Simply add your Clerk API credentials, and you're ready to automate!

## Real-World Use Cases

Imagine automatically adding new users to your CRM when they sign up, triggering onboarding emails based on organization membership, or syncing user data across multiple platforms—all without writing a single line of code.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

This node is open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-clerk-auth. We welcome contributions, feedback, and feature requests from the community.
